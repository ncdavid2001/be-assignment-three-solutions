1. What is middleware in Express.js and how does it work in the request-response cycle?

Middleware in Express.js is a function that has access to the request (req), response (res), and the next middleware in the stack (next). Middleware can modify the request or response, end the request-response cycle, or pass control to the next middleware. Middleware functions are executed in the order they are defined, forming a pipeline through which every request passes.



2. Purpose of each middleware:

cors(): Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing your API to be accessed from web pages hosted on different domains. Without it, browsers block requests from other origins for security reasons.
helmet(): Adds various HTTP headers to help secure your app (e.g., prevents clickjacking, XSS, and other attacks).
compression(): Compresses HTTP responses using gzip or similar algorithms, reducing payload size and improving performance for clients.
express.json(): Parses incoming requests with JSON payloads and makes the data available on req.body. Necessary for APIs that accept JSON input.



3. How does middleware order affect the 
application's behavior?

Middleware order is critical: each middleware is executed in the sequence it is registered. If a middleware is placed before a route, it will process the request before the route handler. If it’s after, it won’t affect that route. Incorrect order can lead to security issues, missed parsing, or routes not working as expected. For example, express.json() must come before any route that needs to access req.body.
