Why is the code organized into separate directories (books/, common/, routes/)?

Organizing code into directories by feature or responsibility (e.g., books/ for book-related logic, common/ for shared utilities, routes/ for route definitions) keeps related files together. This makes the codebase easier to navigate and understand.
How does this structure support scalability and maintainability?

As the application grows, new features or resources can be added as new directories without cluttering existing code. Each module is self-contained, making it easier to update, debug, or refactor specific parts without affecting unrelated code.
What are the benefits of having separate files for controllers, services, and schemas?

Controllers handle HTTP requests and responses.
Services contain business logic and data manipulation.
Schemas/Models define data structures and validation.
Separating these concerns allows for focused development, easier testing, and the ability to change one layer (e.g., switch databases) without rewriting others.


2. Explain the role of the utils.common.js file:



What utility functions are typically included?

Common helpers such as data validation, formatting, error handling, response formatting, or file operations. For example, a sendResponse() function to standardize API responses, or a function to generate unique IDs.
How do these functions promote code reuse across the application?

By centralizing shared logic in utils.common.js, you avoid duplicating code in multiple places. This makes the codebase DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself), easier to maintain, and ensures consistency in how common tasks are handled throughout the application.
