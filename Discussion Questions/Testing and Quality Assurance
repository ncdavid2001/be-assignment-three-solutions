1. **How would you approach testing the different layers of the MVC architecture?**  
   - **Model/Schema:** Write unit tests to verify data validation, schema methods, and data manipulation logic.
   - **Service:** Test business logic in isolation, mocking dependencies like models or external services.
   - **Controller:** Use integration tests to ensure controllers handle requests and responses correctly, including error handling and status codes.
   - **End-to-end (E2E):** Test the full request flow from API endpoint to data storage, simulating real user interactions.

2. **What tools and frameworks would you use for API testing?**  
   - **Jest** or **Mocha** for unit and integration tests.
   - **Supertest** for HTTP assertions and testing Express routes.
   - **Chai** for expressive assertions (often used with Mocha).
   - **Sinon** for mocking and spying on functions.
   - **Postman** or **Insomnia** for manual API testing and automated collections.

3. **How do you ensure API reliability and handle edge cases?**  
   - Write comprehensive tests for all endpoints, including edge cases (e.g., invalid input, missing data, unauthorized access).
   - Validate and sanitize all input.
   - Implement proper error handling and return meaningful error messages.
   - Use monitoring and logging to detect and diagnose issues in production.
   - Regularly review and update tests as the API evolves to catch regressions and new edge cases.
