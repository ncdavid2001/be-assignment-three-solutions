1. What additional security measures would you implement for a production API?

Use HTTPS to encrypt all traffic.
Implement authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth) and authorization to control access.
Rate limit requests to prevent abuse (e.g., express-rate-limit).
Validate and sanitize all user input to prevent injection attacks.
Use security headers with helmet.
Enable CORS only for trusted origins.
Log and monitor suspicious activity.
Keep dependencies updated and avoid known vulnerabilities.


2. How do you handle input validation and sanitization in Express.js applications?

Use libraries like express-validator or Joi to define validation rules for incoming data.
Validate all request data (body, query, params) before processing.
Sanitize inputs to remove or escape harmful content (e.g., strip HTML, escape special characters).
Return clear error messages for invalid input, but avoid exposing sensitive details.


3. What are the best practices for API versioning and backward compatibility?

Include the version in the URL (e.g., /api/v1/books) or in request headers.
Never break existing endpointsâ€”add new features or changes in a new version.
Deprecate old versions gradually and communicate changes to API consumers.
Maintain clear documentation for each version.
Use semantic versioning for major changes.





What additional security measures would you implement for a production API?

Enforce HTTPS to encrypt all data in transit.
Implement authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth) and authorization to restrict access.
Use rate limiting (e.g., with express-rate-limit) to prevent abuse and DoS attacks.
Set secure HTTP headers using helmet.
Enable CORS only for trusted origins.
Validate and sanitize all user input to prevent injection attacks.
Log and monitor requests for suspicious activity.
Regularly update dependencies and patch vulnerabilities.
Store sensitive data (like API keys) in environment variables, not in code.


How do you handle input validation and sanitization in Express.js applications?

Use libraries like express-validator or Joi to define and enforce validation rules for all incoming data (body, query, params).
Sanitize inputs to remove or escape potentially harmful content (e.g., strip HTML, escape special characters).
Validate data before processing it in controllers or services.
Return clear, user-friendly error messages for invalid input, but avoid exposing sensitive details.


What are the best practices for API versioning and backward compatibility?

Include the API version in the URL path (e.g., /api/v1/books) or in request headers.
Never break existing endpoints; introduce breaking changes in a new version.
Deprecate old versions gradually and communicate changes to API consumers.
Maintain clear documentation for each version.
Use semantic versioning and changelogs to track changes and updates.
